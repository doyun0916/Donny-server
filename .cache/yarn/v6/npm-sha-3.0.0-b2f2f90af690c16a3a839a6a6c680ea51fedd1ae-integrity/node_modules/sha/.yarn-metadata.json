The callback will be called with either `null` or an error (indicating that they did not match).\n\nOptions:\n\n- algorithm: defaults to `sha1` and can be any of the algorithms supported by `crypto.createHash`\n\n### get(fileName, [options,] cb) / getSync(filename, [options])\n\nAsynchronously get the \"hash\" of `fileName`.  The callback will be called with an optional `error` object and the (lower cased) hex digest of the hash.\n\nOptions:\n\n- algorithm: defaults to `sha1` and can be any of the algorithms supported by `crypto.createHash`\n\n### stream(expected, [options])\n\nCheck the hash of a stream without ever buffering it.  This is a pass through stream so you can do things like:\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream('src')\n  .pipe(sha.stream('expected'))\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('dest'))\n```\n\n`dest` will be a complete copy of `src` and an error will be emitted if the hash did not match `'expected'`.\n\nOptions:\n\n- algorithm: defaults to `sha1` and can be any of the algorithms supported by `crypto.createHash`\n\n## License\n\nYou may use this software under the BSD or MIT.
